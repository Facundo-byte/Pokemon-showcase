## Description
This is a responsive web application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to search for a Pokémon by name. When a valid name is entered, the app fetches data from the PokéAPI and displays the front-facing image of the corresponding Pokémon.

The layout is fully responsive, designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. No external libraries or frameworks were used—just clean, lightweight code and a focus on user-friendly design.
